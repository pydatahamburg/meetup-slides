**Abstract**
During the last couple of years a lot of progress has been made in a number of NLP tasks. This progress is largely due to new deep learning methods that utilise ever larger data sets. Translating the research progress into new and improved products in industry is not always straightforward; there is often no direct link between an academic NLP task and some automation task in industry. In order to utilise the progress in academia, research engineers need to dissect the automation tasks into smaller pieces that can reasonably be mapped to the ones in academia. Furthermore, business requirements dictate constraints within which a machine learning system, or systems, must operate. These constraints are often missing in academic work.
In this talk I'll use the example of an end to end automation pipeline for travel bookings to show how different modelling decisions impact the overall performance of the pipeline and talk about human-machine hybrids that together fulfil the required performance.

**Bio**
Matti holds a PhD in Natural Language Processing from the University of Sussex, he is currently working as a research scientist at Comtravo GmbH working on and end to end automation pipeline for travel bookings. Beyond his work at Comtravo he is interested in language and linguistics, the philosophy of AI, cycling, photography and coffee. Matti is an active member of the data science community in Berlin, he has been a part of the PyData Berlin committee since 2016.

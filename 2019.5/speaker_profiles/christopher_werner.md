**Abstract**
Automated softwaretests are not to be missed in todays software development processes. Usually there are plenty of testcases to be run on a cyclic basis to ensure functionality. New implementations are risking earlier working states and thus need to be tested. Executing all testcases needs a lot of computation power and can take up to weeks. So, if the results of testcases could be predicted based on earlier outcomes, time and energy could be reduced dramatically.
In this talk an approach for predicting the outcomes of testcases based on earlier exeuctions via trained MLPs is presented. Different training styles as well as other options will be considered and discussed. Finally, all optiones will be tied together for answering the question, if neuronal networks are able to predict status changes in software tests.

**Bio**
Christopher did his master thesis on the topic introduced above. He recently graduated from the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg where he studied 'Computer Science'. Afterwards he began working as an IT-Consultant at Netlight Consulting GmbH.

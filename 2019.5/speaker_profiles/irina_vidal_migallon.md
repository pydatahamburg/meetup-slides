**Abstract**
For several years now, industrial Computer Vision systems have been powered by Deep Learning - also in production. If we should poke our code until it breaks, why would deep learning models gets a free pass? We'll see different ways in which to poke, improve and -above all- robustify a vision model before letting it run in production.

**Bio**
I'm an Electrical engineer specialised in Machine Learning & Vision over the years. I've been working as a Computer Vision engineer in industries ranging from medical (optical biopsy systems at France’s INRIA) to surgery planning tools and Augmented Reality in the Berlin start-up scene and, recently, the CV & AI team at Siemens Mobility. Over the last years I've seen the hype turned bashing of Deep Learning and a number of projects where lessons were learnt.
